the best way I can think of be simply download and store the json as file in the app . then , if the content may have be update , you should override the previously download file with the new one , at app launch . 

here be sample code take from link to store and retrieve json file locally : 

please tell I if you need help for Swift translation : -rrb- 

I do not think it be a heavy operation to have 11 * 200kb nearly 2 mb , in memory share as a singleton array 

regard send app to background , the content will not reset if the app be leave work by IOS , but if close you will get a new launch when you open it again with array content be initiate from the begining 

regard the download every launch , i recommend have expire or new datum flag , you should store they in a file/coredata or any other alternative and , it be best to implement CW , to read they as cw to object and vice versa when save
