lexrank.summarize("even though the code work the same, and CW call be cache. in you case there be no need for that extra function call on every new instance, so it will be faster -lrb- not that it matter in this case -rrb- to do the following:. another thing to notice, be that CW be synchronous, so if you json be specially large, the first time you instanciate CW the event loop will be block. use it at the very begin it will probably have load before the server -lrb- or whatever you be do -rrb- have start, so there would be no issue in the CW take some time. so, yes, in my opinion, CW call should be at the top, unless you know what you be do, or you be load a dynamic dependency. be this a bad practice ?. not really, CW have a cache so it do not matter a lot. I have hear people say that you should always use require in the beginning of you code. yes, that be a good practice so that one can easily spot the dependency. should I just require the whole thing in the beginning of my code cw and then simply extract only the require language cw inside of the constructor ?. yes, I would do that. I would only put cw inside the constructor if it be a dynamic dependency, like CW. / config/lang / $ -lcb- lang -rcb-. jsoncw.", 1, function (err, toplines, text) { console.log(toplines); });
