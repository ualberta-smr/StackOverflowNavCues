lexrank.summarize("not sure if lib/framework exist, but if you would like to do it automatically and you would like to avoid manual labour:--rrb- stick with cw... take it as a rough example, lack proper conversion support, lack recursion,... it be just cw demonstration... P.S.. here it be do in CW, but you be go to enhance CW and then you will be able to convert all cw subclass. no need to implement this in all subclasses/managed object. UPDATE: cw protocol introduce in Swift 4 should be sufficient for most of the CW parsing case. below answer be for people who be stick in previous version of Swift and for legacy reason. link:. example:. link:. example:. I work a bit on a smaller solution that do not require inheritance. but it have not be test much. it be pretty ugly atm. link. you can pass it into a playground to test it. E.g. follow class structure:. print. this be not a perfect/automatic solution but I believe this be the idiomatic and native way to do such. this way you do not need any library or such. create a protocol such as:. then implement it in you class such as:. now:. note: if you want cw as a string, it be very simply to convert to a string: cw. in swift 4, you can inherit from the CW type. along with Swift 4 -lrb- Foundation -rrb- now it be natively support in both way, json string to a object - a object to json string. please see Apple 's documentation here link and here link. JSON String to Object. Swift Object to jsonstring. you can find all detail and example here link. this example code in utf8.", 1, function (err, toplines, text) { console.log(toplines); });
