lexrank.summarize("Java class example, this class have two field that represent the person name and birth date of a person. these field be annotated with the @SerializedName annotation. the parameter -lrb- value -rrb- of this annotation be the name to be use when CW and CW object. for example, the Java field personName be represent as name in JSON. JSON Example, there be already few answer here, but I would like to add that if you be use CW to obfuscate you code & do not use CW in you model class, then you gson will not work. because due to obfuscation, you variable name might have change from CW to CW result into broken gson parsing as GSON will look for key cw into json & it will fail. by specify CW, GSON will not look in json base on variable name & will just use specify CW. of Course you can tell proguard to not obfuscate you model, but if you would like to have model obfuscate, then you must specify CW.", 1, function (err, toplines, text) { console.log(toplines); });
