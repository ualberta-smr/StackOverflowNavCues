lexrank.summarize("I would understand if it be just -lsb- object -rsb- or -lsb- object -rsb-, but why -lsb- object object -rsb- ? because it be a object create from the basic CW class. from link: return the String value that be the result of concatenate the three Strings '' -lsb- object '', class, and '' -rsb- ''. be it part of json or JavaScript ? it have absolutely nothing to do with json. all object have a cw method that display something in the format CW, where type be the object type. when call on CW you get CW and when call on a object you get the string cw because it be base on the link -lrb- capital `` o '' -rrb-, that be why it say CW twice, it be a object of the type Object. link. JSON be a lightweight data-interchange format, and do not really have anything to do with JavaScript other than be name `` JavaScript Object Notation '' because it be write like a JavaScript object. the first CW denote that the type of the thing be log be a object. it be also hard-coded in the language specification link. the second cw denote the constructor property, for example: the algorithm just say: `` get the -lsb- -lsb- class -rsb- -rsb- property of the object and then return ' -lsb- object ' + class + ' -rsb- '. you have basically hit the platonic wall end of the cave. if everything be a object, what be the superset of object ? here, the answer be embody in the code, it be simply object. hence all object be object. welcome to the circularity.", 1, function (err, toplines, text) { console.log(toplines); });
