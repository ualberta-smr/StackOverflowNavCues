here be the complete list of build-in function that can be use to create json object in postgresql . link 

well ... ok , will we can not use any classic function . 

let 's take a look at some aggregate function and hope for the best ... link 

CW be the only aggregate function that build object , that be we only chance to tackle this problem . the trick here be to find the correct way to feed the cw function . 

here be my test table and datum 

and after some trial and error with cw here be a query you can use to merge json1 and json2 in postgresql 9.4 

EDIT : for postgresql 9.5 + , look at Zubin 's answer below 

also you can tranform json into text , concatenate , replace and convert back to json . use the same datum from ClÃ©ment you can do : 

you could also concatenate all json1 into single json with : 

however this question be answer already some time ago ; the fact that when CW and CW contain the same key ; the key appear twice in the document , do not seem to be link . 

therefore u can use this cw function with postgresql 9.5 : 

the follow query return the concatenate jsonb column , where the key in CW be dominant over the key in CW : 



FYI , if someone 's use jsonb in > = 9.5 and they only care about top-level element be merge without duplicate key , then it be as easy as use the | | operator : 

in Postgres 9.5 + you can merge JSONB like this : 

or , if it be JSON , coerce to JSONB if necessary : 

or : 

-lrb- otherwise , any null value in CW or CW return a empty row -rrb- 

for example : 

kudos to @MattZukowski for point this out in a comment . 

this function would merge nested json object
