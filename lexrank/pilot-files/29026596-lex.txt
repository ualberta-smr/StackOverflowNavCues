lexrank.summarize("you issue be because the CW attribute be define as cw which you expect to be of type CW, CW, etc, but be actually of a object which have inner attribute like CW. to resolve this, you need to introduce another level of class which have the require attribute CW, CW, CW etc.. this can be easily achieve use static inner class. if I can suggest to change something in json be that you have to add at one new field that define the type of datum, so json should look like below:. the CW class have to have new file CW so it should look like below:. the CW be a enum which define type of datum. you have to pass data.class as param in constructor. for all datum type you have to create new class. cw enum should look like below:. the desarializator for json should look like below:. and when you create CW, in the line where you register Deserializator, you should use this:. other class -lrb- type of datum -rrb- you define like standard pojo for Gson in separated class. Might be a little bit off-topic, but what happen if the inner object contain a date property ? my typeadapter look like this:. but due to the parsing which be do by this: cw. it will throw a error whenever it will try to deserialize the date property. be there a quick fix for this ?. EDIT: marked the answer as accept, definitely:-rrb- it help I fix my issue. but now there be this problem with the date deserializer.", 1, function (err, toplines, text) { console.log(toplines); });
