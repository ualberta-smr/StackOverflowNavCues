lexrank.summarize("even without see you json string you can tell from the error message that it be not the correct structure to be parse into a instance of you class. gson be expect you json string to begin with a object open brace. e.g. but the string you have pass to it start with a open quote. maybe you cw be right, but the response that you receive be not you valid data.Just like when you connect the invalid CW, you may receive a strange response cw that CW can not parse. you may need to do some cw for this strange response to avoid crash. invalid json from the server should always be a expect use case. a million thing can go wrong during transmission. gson be a bit tricky, because its error output will give you one problem, and the actual exception you catch will be of a different type. with all that in mind, the proper fix on the client side be. if you want to know why the JSON you receive from the server be wrong, you can look inside you catch block at the exception. but even if it be you problem, it be not the client 's responsibility to fix JSON it be receive from the internet. either way, it be the client 's responsibility to decide what to do when it get bad json. two possibility be reject the json and do nothing, and try again. if you be go to try again, I highly recommend set a flag inside the try / catch block and then respond to that flag outside the try / catch block. nested try / catch be likely how Gson get we into this mess with we stack trace and exception not match up. in other word, even though I will admit it do not look very elegant, I would recommend. in retrofit2, when you want to send you parameter in raw you must use Scalars. first add this in you gradle: -rcb- -rcb- Reference: -lsb- link. do not use CW on a json object. make sure you have deserialize object like date/datetime etc.. if you be directly send json without deserialize it then it can cause this problem. I have come to share a solution. the error happen to I after force the notbook to hang up. possible solution cw. in my case, I be return JSON Object as. -lcb- `` datum '': '' '', `` message '': `` Attendance Saved successfully.. !!! '', `` status '': `` success '' -rcb- resolve by change it as. -lcb- `` datum '':{ -rcb-, `` message '': `` Attendance Saved successfully.. !!! '', `` status '': `` success '' -rcb- here datum be a sub jsonobject and it should start from -lcb- not '' '' if you json format and variable be okay then check you database query... even if datum be save in db correctly the actual problem might be in there... recheck you query and try again.. Hope it help.", 1, function (err, toplines, text) { console.log(toplines); });
