if you input field value be number , then you can use input type ` number ' . the min and max attribute represent number range to input . Hope this be much simpler . 

update 

inorder to hide the arrow you could use the follow . 

you can use this regex if you have to use CW 

you can use a text input and allow only number to be type in , with the use of CW . from 48 to 57 be the keyboard number from 0-9 . 

if it pass this validation then you check if it exceede the max value of you input . 

for the min value , the user can not enter something below CW because to do that he should be able to write CW , which do not pass the first condition -lrb- number only -rrb-
