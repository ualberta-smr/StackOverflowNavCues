lexrank.summarize("just access the propertie of the CW object in the second ng-repeat. like CW. for this exact json input it should be like this: however as you say you want non fixed number of option, update you json to be like this: and then you code should work as you want it. you can add each new element to list with simple coma before it. you should probably make you CW a object and not a array contain a single object. note the difference between these: you can then iterate the option with a ng-repeat like discuss link: replace you child cw with cw and then you can iterate CW like so: or if you cw may include more then one object: if you do not need object key: link. extended explanation: in you example you have CW tag inside another CW: since it be not a valid HTML browser will interpret this markup to follow: since CW create new scope for each iteration you can not access CW variable in second cw and iterator would not run. since user.options be a array you should loop it again. by do that you will get a object, with that object you can access you options1 and option2 easily. please refer work plunker: link. see through the code if you have any doubt. Hope this help. a little aside, but just find out you can render a valid list HTML use CW in combination with cw for the give array of array to flatten they:", 1, function (err, toplines, text) { console.log(toplines); });
